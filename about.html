                    <h2>Past Speakers</h2>
                    <h3>Jeff Bezos</h3>
                    Jeff Bezos founded e-commerce giant Amazon in 1994 out of his Seattle garage.
                    Bezos stepped down as CEO to become executive chairman in 2021. He owns a bit less than 10% of the company.
                    He and his wife MacKenzie divorced in 2019 after 25 years of marriage and he transferred a quarter of his then-16% Amazon stake to her.
                    Bezos donated more than $1.1 million worth of stock to nonprofits in 2023, though it's unclear which organizations received those shares
                    He owns The Washington Post and Blue Origin, an aerospace company developing rockets; he briefly flew to space in one in July 2021.

                    <h3>Bill Gates</h3>
                    Bill Gates diversified his fortune from software firm Microsoft into dozens of holdings, including waste disposal firm Republic Services and tractor maker Deere & Co.
                    Gates, a computer enthusiast from a young age, dropped out of Harvard to cofound Microsoft with Paul Allen (d. 2018) in 1975, hoping to capitalize on the spread of personal computers.
                    As of March 2020, when Gates stepped down from the Microsoft board, he owned about 1.3% of the software and computing company's shares.

                    <h3>Mark Zukerberg</h3>
                    A 19-year-old Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook in 2004 for students to match names with photos of classmates.
                    Zuckerberg took Facebook public in 2012; he now owns about 13% of the company's stock.
                    Facebook changed its name to Meta in 2021 to shift the company's focus to the metaverse.
                    In 2015, Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, pledged to give away 99% of their Meta stake over their lifetimes.
